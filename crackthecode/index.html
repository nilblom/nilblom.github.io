		<h1><a href="../">< home</a> Introduction</h1>

		<p>I started to build a program that can solve games of 'Crack the Code' mid November 2025. By late January 2026 the theory and the program both seem to work.</p>

		<h2>What is 'Crack the Code'?</h2>

		<p>'Crack the Code' is a game where a secret code is cracked with the help of tips that show how
		parts of the code is formed.</p>
		
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The game starts by player one coming up with a secret code (three unique numbers). The same player then writes a series of tips (typically 4).</li>
			<li>The code is a three-digit number (variants of the game where there are less or more than this exist).</li>
			<li>The other player uses the tips to figure out what the secret code is (there may be multiple solutions).</li>
			<li>The tips must together contain each digit that is in the secret code.</li>
			<li>Each tip typically indicate a part of the code. There are three components to a tip: 1) the digits (as many as there are in the secret code) 2) a number that indicate how many of the digits are also in the secret code 3) a number that indicate how many of the digits are correctly placed relative to the secret code.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Game dictionary</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>secret code: A three-digit (all unique) number that is only known to one of the players.</li>
			<li>digit: One of the elements in a code. For example, 1 in [1, 2, 3] is a digit.</li>
			<li>tip: The three elements “number of digits in the code” (<i>x</i>), “number of correctly placed digits in the code” (<i>y</i>) and the digits that the previous two statements applies for (see <i>tip code</i>). x is always equal to or greater than y.
			<li>x: See <i>tip</i>.</li>
			<li>y: See <i>tip</i>.</li>
			<li>tip code: The three-digit code used in a tip. It usually contains one or more digits from the secret code.</li>
			<li>hypothesis: A list of one <i>positive hypothesis</i> and zero or more <i>negative hypotheses</i>.</li>
			<li>positive hypothesis: Something resembling a <i>tip code</i>. It codes a guess or <i>hypothesis</i> about the structure and content of the <i>secret code</i>.</li>
			<li>negative hypothesis: It has the same structure as a <i>positive hypothesis</i>, but the negative hypothesis expresses what forms the secret code cannot take.</li>
			<li>solution: A set of hypotheses that produces the secret code (or one of the secret codes).</li>
			<li>grand hypothesis: A set of hypotheses that may be a solution.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Example game</h2>

		<p>The secret code is 348. The list of tips (x, y, digits) are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2 1 314</li>
			<li>0 0 560</li>
			<li>1 0 214</li>
			<li>2 1 387</li>
		</ul>
		<p>From the tips above, it is possible to reach the conclusion that 348 is the secret code. I will present details about each tip below. One way to solve the game methodically is to create hypotheses about what the code can look like and then combine them together. I will use a method that does this, which is also one I came up with. (This is also the method that I have implemented in a Python program that is available for download on this page.) I have marked in black the hypotheses (partial solutions) that solve this particular example game.</p>

		<h3>Tip 1/4: x=2 y=1 314</h3>

		<p>From x and y one can tell that of 3, 1, and 4 only two are in the secret code, and that one of them is in the correct position. It is not possible to know which the digits are, but by creating hypotheses it is possible to solve the game.</p>

		<p>I start creating hypotheses by assuming that the digit 3 is in the correct position, then 1, then 4 (see the table below). But since x=2 I have to add another number to my hypotheses. I start with 1 since it is the next number in the code. With 3 fixed and 1 being the other digit, there is only one option: 3_1. The other (31_) has two digits matching the positions in the tip code, so it must be discarded because of the requirement set by y. Choosing 3 and 4, 34_ is the possible option. 3_4 cannot be possible since it would also imply that y=2.</p>

		<p>Having assumed that 3 is the cause of y=1, it's time to move on to the second digit: 1. 31_ and  _14 are not valid, but _13 and 41_ are. The reasoning is the same as in the previous paragraph.</p>

		<p>Moving on to using 4 as the correctly placed digit, the possible hypotheses are _34, and 1_4. With the secret code already revealed, it is possible to see the partial solution from the first tip that matches the code: 34_ (see the black cell).</p>

		<p>Hypotheses that possibly fulfil these requirements are in the table below. The cells of impossible hypotheses have been colored red.</p>

		<table border=1px style="caption-side: bottom;font-family: monospace;">
			<caption>Hypotheses for 314, x=2, y=1.</caption>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>1</td><td>4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background:red;">31_ (__4,)</td><td style="background:red;">31_ (__4,)</td><td>_34 (1__,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3_1 (_4_,)</td><td>_13 (4__,)</td><td style="background:red;">3_4 (_1_,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="color: white; background: black;">34_ (__1,)</td><td>41_ (__3,)</td><td style="background:red;">_14 (3__,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background:red;">3_4 (_1_,)</td><td style="background:red;">_14 (3__,)</td><td>1_4 (_3_,)</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Tip 2/4: x=0 y=0 560</h3>

		<p>A tip where x=0, y=0 can be interpreted as an empty positive hypothesis. Any digit may occur except for the ones in the tip code. To express that, negative hypotheses are created. It is enough to create hypotheses such that each digit has occupied every slot in total (you can do this by rotating the number three times). Why is it enough? The x=0 y=0 type tips express that each number in the tip code may not occur in any position in the code. If one creates negative hypotheses where each digit has (in total) occupied every position, the same idea has been expressed. It is also timely to mention that the function to determine if two hypotheses are compatible will evaluate each digit in turn and make sure that (for example) 5 does not occur anywhere in the other hypotheses (the one being compared to).</p>

		<table border=1px style="caption-side:bottom;font-family: monospace;">
		<caption>Hypotheses for 560, x=0, y=0.</caption>
		<tr>
			<td style="color: white; background: black;">___ (650, 065, 506)</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Tip 3/4: x=1 y=0 214</h3>

		<p>In this tip, only one digit in the tip code is in the secret code. And it is not in the correct position. I have started by assuming that 2 is that number (in the first row), then 1 (in the second row), and then 4 (in the third row). In each hypothesis, the number takes a place that is not the place of the number in the tip code.</p>

		<p>If you peek at the hypotheses, you can see that the correct one was found. It is correct because you can combine _4_ with 348 without conflict. Both hypotheses say that the 4 should be in the middle position.</p>

		<table border=1px style="caption-side: bottom;font-family: monospace;">
			<caption>Hypotheses for 214, x=1, y=0.</caption>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>_2_ (1_4, 4_1,)</td><td>1__ (_24, _42,)</td><td>4__ (_21, _12,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>__2 (43_, 34_,)</td><td>__1 (24_, 42_,)</td><td style="color: white; background: black;">_4_ (2_1, 1_2,)</td>
		</tr>
		
		</table>

		<h3>Tip 4/4: x=2 y=1 387</h3>

		<p>The reasoning to create hypotheses for this tip is the same as for the previous tips.</p>

		<table border=1px style="caption-side: bottom;font-family: monospace;">
			<caption>Hypotheses for 387, x=2, y=1.</caption>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td><td>8</td><td>7</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background:red;">38_ (__7,)</td>
			<td style="background:red;">38_ (__7,)</td>
			<td>37_ (__8,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="color: white; background: black;">3_8 (_7_,)</td>
			<td>_83 (7__,)</td>
			<td>_73 (8__,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>37_ (__8,)</td>
			<td>78_ (__7,)</td>
			<td style="background:red;">87_ (__3,)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background:red;">3_7 (_8_,)</td>
			<td style="background:red;">_87 (3__,)</td>
			<td>_78 (3__,)</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Combining hypotheses</h3>

		Like you saw in the previous sections, hypotheses have been noted for each of the four tips. They can now be combined in different ways to form grand hypotheses. One (or sometimes several) of them are solutions while others are not.

		Only hypotheses that are compatible with each other can be combined to form a grand hypotheses. Compatability can be defined as a function that takes two hypotheses and makes a series of comparisons between the two. The song goes like this: if two hypotheses are equal or if both are negative hypotheses, they are not in conflict with each other, so they are compatible. If that condition is not met, then if the hypotheses are both positive, and for each of the digits, one check whether they fit. A fit between the two is defined as one of the two conditions being fulfilled: 1) the digits are equal 2) one or the other of the digits is blanked. Only if all of the digits fit are the two hypotheses compatible. Further, if one of the hypotheses is negative and the two digits are equal, they are not compatible.

		Once you have understood the concept of compatible hypotheses, it is relatively easy to pick out compatible ones that form a solution from the tables above, simply with your eye.

		<h2>Programming a solution finder</h2>

		<p>The method used so far is enough of a method that it can be programmed into a computer program.</p>

		<p>One thing that was not addressed in the previous sections is how to in practice combine the hypotheses and decide if they are all compatible with each other (the goal here is to find out if they can form a solution). To programmatically find the solutions from the lists of hypotheses, we can create the cartesian product of the four tables. It involves finding every combination of one hypotheses from each table. Then it is a matter of, for each two hypotheses in each grand hypothesis, compute if they are compatible or not. If all hypotheses are compatible with each other, a grand hypothesis is also a solution.</p>

		<p>There is also the possibility to, at each step of combining a hypotheses with one from the next table, checking for compatibility. That way the computer never creates grand hypotheses that are not solutions, thus saving power. Because the items that need to be combined are relatively few, there is less gain to be had compared to if the items were in the thousands, ten-thousands or hundreds of thousands. Therefore this exercise is left out to the reader. If you want to, you can send your own solution to me for correction.</p>

		<p>Let's move on to how to complete the program. To start with, in order to write a program that can solve Crack the Code, the input to the program (the tips) must be coded for the computer. I decided to use the Python programming language because of its simplicity. The following sections are easier to follow if you have already learned Python.</p>

		<h3>Creating data structures</h3>

		<p>A tip can easily be coded using a tuple. The properties <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> can occupy the first two positions. The tip code can occupy the third position. It is easy to reference to each digit in the code if it is split into digits and put in a list.</p>

		<table border="1px"><title>Coding tips</title>
			<tr>
				<th colspan=3>Tip</th><th>Coded tip</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>x</td><td>Number of digits present</td><td>2</td><td rowspan=3>[2, 1, [1, 2, 3]]</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>y</td><td>Number of digits placed correctly</td><td>1</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>[a, b, c]</td><td>The digits in the tip</td><td>[1, 2, 3]</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Hypotheses contain both positive and negative hypothesis. Their structure is similar to the secret code and tip code, but they may contain blanks as in [1, "_", 3]. To distinguish positive and negative hypothesis, I put a zero (negative hypothesis) or one (positive hypothesis) in front of the digits.</p>
		<table border="1px"><title>Positive and negative hypotheses</title>
			<tr>
				<th colspan=2>Hypotheses</th><th>Coded hypothesis</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td><td>Positive hypothesis</td><td>[1, [1, 2, 3]]</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>0</td><td>Negative hypothesis</td><td>[0, [1, 2, 3]]</td>
			</tr>
			
		</table>

		<h2>A pseudo-code description of the game</h2>
		<p>For each tip, create a list of the permutations of the tip code.</p>
		<p>If x is 0, create an empty positive hypothesis [[1, ["_", "_", "_"]]]. Create negative hypotheses from the tip code. Append each one to the end of the list with the positive hypothesis. Return/stop.</p>
		<p>If x > 0, for each permutation, create combinations of size x. For example, from a tip code [1, 2, 3] and x being 2, the combinations are (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3).</p>
		<p>For each such combination, iterate over the indices of the tip code. For each iteration, see if the current digit is in the combination. If it is, only increment the counter that keeps track of how many digits are in the correct slot relative to the tip code. If the digit is not in the combination, blank it with a "_". At this stage, a positive hypothesis has been produced and together with it maybe a negative hypothesis.</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Negative hypotheses (presented above) that indicate which digits may not occur are also made. This is especially true when the tip has the form (0, 0, 123) which indicate the numbers that do not occur in the secret code. (0, 0, ...) tips are very useful since they show the digits that are not present in the secret code. The other type of negative hypotheses result from creating positive hypotheses: (1, 1, 123) indicate that one of the digits is in the secret code, and that just that digit is also in the correct position. It means that if one hypothesis is 1__, the digits two and three may not occur in the empty positions (and in any order). If it did, x and y both would be different. The example (1, 1, 123) produces the negative hypotheses _23 and _32. If the numbers could be in the positive hypothesis, the tip would look like (3, 1, 123). Such a tip generates hypotheses like 132.</li>

			<li>The player that is trying to crack the code makes <i>positive and negative hypotheses</i> from the tips.</li>

			<li>By combining different hypotheses that are compatible with each other (one from each tip, including its negative hypotheses) the code can be found out. The positive hypotheses from a tip like (0, 0, ...) is always ___ (three empty slots) and is accompanied by its negative hypotheses, which is always 3.</li>

			<li>Several solutions can exist. To win the game, one or more solutions must be provided. The solution is a code with as many numbers as is in the secret code.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Motivating the use of negative hypotheses</h2>

		<p>In an example where two of the tips are 1 1 123 and 2 2 423, the use of negative hypotheses have the effect of discarding incompatible hypotheses. Consider the hypothesis 1__ (from the first tip). It would be considered compatible with _23 (from the second tip) if the negative hypotheses _23 is not taken into account. If _23 would be the right choice, the first tip should say 3 3 123, since also 2 and 3 are in the correct positions.</p>
